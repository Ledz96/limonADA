# Oil

After the fall of the Bretton Woods agreement and the introduction 
of the [Petrodollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar_recycling) in
the '70s, oil became one of the world's most strategic resources.  

During the course of past century, oil has taken a central spot in the World's economy: as we can see from the graph below, millions of barrels of oil are used every day, and its use has been steadily increasing. In addition, entire economies are based on the extraction and sale of this good, so much that the term "petrodollars" has been introduced to identify the billions of dollars of revenue generated by the sale of oil. Given its undeniable importance in the economy, as well as its heterogeneous distribution over the globe, oil has had an enormous influence on the political balance between countries. 

In this data story, we will attempt to determine whether or not the abundance of oil in a country has an influence in its well-being.

In the first section, we will use data provided by ... database to find out whether or not oil is correlated to social issues in a country. In particular, we will take into account factors such as illiteracy, life expectancy, and gini score. In case a correlation is found, we will then dive deeper, and wonder whether oil can be cause of these issues.

In the second section, we will take inspiration from _insert civil war paper_ , and try to build a predictor for the presence of war in a country: this will serve the purpose of identifying the most influential variables for this event, as they will be needed for the following part.

In the third and final section, we will try to investigate the role of oil in the welloutburst on conflict. In particular, we will try to understand whether or not the large availability of oil in a country can influence the probability of a war outbreaking in that location.
