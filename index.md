# Influence of oil on wellbeing and peace in a country

## Why the focus on oil?

During the course of past century, oil has taken a central spot in the World's economy: as we can see from the graph below, the use of oil has been steadily increasing in the past 50 years, with millions of barrels of oil consumed every day. In addition, entire economies are based on the extraction and sale of this strategic good, so much that the term "petrodollars" has been introduced to identify the billions of dollars of revenue generated by the sale of oil. Given its undeniable importance in the economy, as well as its heterogeneous distribution over the globe, oil has had an enormous influence on the political balance between countries. 

Great oil exporters, however, have often been linked with controversies. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, for instance, officially justified with the concern over presence of weapons of mass distruction, is widely attributed to economical factors, related to the abundance of oil in the territory https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2242rank.html. More recently, the poor working conditions and dramatic economical and social inequality in Qatar (14th oil exporter in 2014 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2242rank.html) have been prominent in the news, following its choice as the host country for the 2022 World Cup. Indeed, it is not hard to find more similar examples.

In this data story, we will therefore attempt to back this common perception up with data: we will attempt to determine whether or not oil-rich countries are in fact more vulnerable to social inequality, poor life conditions, and war.

## What to expect

In the first section, we will use data provided by ... database to find out whether or not oil is correlated to social issues in a country. In particular, we will take into account factors such as illiteracy, life expectancy, and gini score. In case a correlation is found, we will then dive deeper, and wonder whether oil can be cause of these issues.

In the second section, we will take inspiration from _insert civil war paper_ , and try to build a predictor for the presence of war in a country: this will serve the purpose of identifying the most influential variables for this event, as they will be needed for the following part.

In the third and final section, we will try to investigate the role of oil in the welloutburst on conflict. In particular, we will try to understand whether or not the large availability of oil in a country can influence the probability of a war outbreaking in that location.
